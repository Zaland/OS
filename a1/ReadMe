Compile the make file "make -f Makefile". This will compile the DSMS.c and prepare a DSMS 
program. Compile stream.c as well to provide a stream of input for the DSMS ("gcc -o stream stream.c"). 

The DSMS requires one parameter, a filename for a configuration file. This configuration file contains 5 
options in this format, the init filename is optional:
db database_name
init file_name
usr1 file_name
usr2 file_name
clean integer_value

The stream requires 5 parameters before proceeding to start. They are in this order:
input_file
data_periodicity
output_file
interrupt_number
DSMS_Process

Run the DSMS first and a process ID will be printed out. Use that process ID for the stream program. Run 
sql commands in the DSMS by preceeding all commands with the command exec. No function for exec at the 
moment, future functionality incomming.
